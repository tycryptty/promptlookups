    "name": "Create Thought Map",
    "objective": "To create a compact, logically structured mind map in Mermaid from a provided PDF, focusing on key concepts and their relationships.",
    "content": "Upload the PDF: Provide the PDF file that contains the document to be analyzed. Analyze the PDF: Identify and summarize the main concepts and ideas presented in the document. Determine the hierarchical importance of these concepts based on the content and emphasis in the text. Select Key Concepts: Focus on 5 main subtrees based on their importance and relevance. Ensure that these subtrees encompass the most critical areas covered in the document. Create an Oriented Graph in Mermaid: Structure the mind map to reflect the logical flow and hierarchy of the concepts. Use arrows to indicate the direction of logical progression and relationships between concepts. Ensure the depth and width of the tree are balanced, aiming for a similar number of levels and branches. Balance the Graph: Adjust the layout to make it compact and readable. Stack sub-branches vertically where possible to minimize horizontal spread. Generate Mermaid Code: Create the Mermaid code for the mind map based on the identified concepts and structure."
